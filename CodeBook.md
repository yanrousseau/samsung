# Aggregation of Samsung S smartphone data using R - CodeBook.md

## Description
This function combines data files collected from Samsung Galaxy X smartphones and aggregates data by activity (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying) and by subject (30 participants took part in data collection).

## Procedure
The script must be placed in the working directory, which also contains data files. A tidy file is returned in the same directory as the input data. To run the script, set the working directory and enter "run_analysis.R()" in the R console. The file produced will be called 'tidy.txt'.
